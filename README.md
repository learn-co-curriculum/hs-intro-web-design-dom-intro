This unit will cover working with the DOM (Document Object Model). A standard cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents within the browser.

Every time you use JavaScript or jQuery to add a style, extra content, or animations to a page, you are manipulating the DOM.
